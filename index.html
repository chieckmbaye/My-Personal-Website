            Hello! My name is Chieck Mbaye and I am a rising junior at Friends
            Seminary. I've had an interest in computer science and engineering
            since about the 5th grade. I have been apart of my school's spring
            track team since the ninth grade and their winter track team since
            the tenth. I am apart of 2 chrous groups, one inside of my school
            and one outside of my school.

            I have a few hobbies that I indugle myself in at school. I joined my
            school's track team becuse I found it to be fun. Although, I am not
            as fast as some of my teammates, I still find it to be enjoyable.
            The event I do the best in is the 100 meter dash, as I cannot run
            for long distances while competing with someone. Anther hobby I
            indugle myself in and outside of school is music. I am apart of my
            school chorus and another chorus that does preformances in places
            like Carnegie Hall.
